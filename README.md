Requires .NET Core 3.0.

Creates a randomizes circle of players and targets from a given array, then acts as an interface for players to receive their targets.

Run with:
> ./bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.0/assassins

Exit with:
> quit
The quit command was hidden because players kept quitting after receiving their targets, thus resetting the game.
